Instructions to push your code to code.google.com
=================================================
1. Sign into GitHub and create a new repository
        Repository name: twu-biblioteca-yourname
        Privacy level: Public
        Don't check "Initialize this repository with a README"
        Add .gitignore: None
        Add a license: Apache License 2.0

2. Run 'git init' in the folder that was extracted from the downloaded .zip file, in order to
 initialize local repository.

3. Make a local commit.
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m “Initial commit”

(Dont forget to add the hidden .idea folder, as it will make opening your project in Intellij easier.)

4. After you are done with the local commit, you can share your code with "The World" by pushing it to your
 GitHub repository.
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/twu-biblioteca-<YOURNAME>
    $ git push origin master
